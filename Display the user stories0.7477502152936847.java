To generate a Spring Boot application with controller, service, and repository classes for the given user story, the following steps can be followed:

1. Create a new Spring Boot project using the Spring Initializr. 
2. In the project, create a Controller class for handling the request for fetching the user stories from the Jira API. 
3. Create a Service class for implementing the logic for fetching the user stories from the Jira API. 
4. Create a Repository class for connecting to the Jira API and fetching the user stories. 
5. Implement the logic in the Controller, Service and Repository classes for fetching the user stories from the Jira API and displaying it in the front-end application. 
6. Add the necessary tests to verify that the user stories are successfully fetched and displayed in the front-end application. 
7. Run the tests to make sure that all the acceptance criteria and acceptance testing are met. 
8. Deploy the application. 
9. Once the application is deployed, verify that all the acceptance criteria and testing are met and the user stories are successfully displayed in the front-end application.
